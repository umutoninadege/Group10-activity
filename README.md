### 1. Student Grading system

-A Python program to input student name and marks, calculate the average, and display the student's information and average grade.

### 2. Text Iterator Application

-A Python script that takes two text inputs, combines them, and then iterates through the combined text to display individual characters.

Conclusion
In this practical , we developed two Python-based applications to demonstrate core programming concepts.

1. Student Management System – Built using Object-Oriented Programming to manage student data securely, calculate average grades, and display all relevant information.

2. Text Iterator Application – Focused on string handling, combining user inputs, checking for palindromes, and iterating over characters using loops and lists.

These tasks helped practice core concepts like classes, functions, encapsulation, string manipulation, and user input handling — essential skills for real-world Python development.
